# GST_Chatbot
GST FAQ chatbot kernel using Custom Bayesian Classifier

In this project have developed a custom Bayesian classifier for answering 60 FAQ questions (taken from government websites for GST) of users.
Also I have created dataset of my own which has 5 different instances of same question so a total of 300 (60x5) questions dataset was created.
The python packages used for pre-processing are pandas, nltk, re and sklearn.
The result came out to be good when tested with some new random questions.
